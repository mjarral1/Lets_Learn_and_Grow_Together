        <h2 style="color: orange">Review of Lesson 1 and 2: </h2>
    <p>In lesson 1 and 2, we had learned about how to set-up Git and Github Account. We also learned how to initialize repositories.<br>
        We had learned some basic commands like git add, git commit, git push, and so on. We also learned how to create, switch, merge, push, pull, and remove branches in git repository.<br>
       From today, we will learn how to work as a team member of a developers' team.<br>
        Let me introduce you other team members! Mary, Jane, and Raja. They are part of a small development team working on a new web application. To stay organized and collaborate
        efficiently, they use Git and GitHub.
        One day, while working on the project, they encountered a merge conflict.Letâ€™s follow their journey as they learn to track changes and resolve conflicts, ensuring their workflow remains smooth.
