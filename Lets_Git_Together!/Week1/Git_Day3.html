    <section>
        <h2 style="color: orange">Review of Lesson 1 and 2: </h2>
    <p>In Lessons 1 and 2, we covered how to set up Git and GitHub accounts, as well as how to initialize repositories. We also learned some basic Git commands like git add, git commit, git push, and more. Additionally, 
     we explored how to create, switch, merge, push, pull, and remove branches in a Git repository.
    Starting today, we‚Äôll dive into working as a team member in a developer team.
    Let me introduce you to other team members: Mary, Jane, and Raja. They‚Äôre part of a small development team working on a new web application. To stay organized and collaborate efficiently, they use Git and GitHub for version control. One day, while working on the project, they encountered a merge conflict.
    Let‚Äôs follow their journey as they learn how to track changes, resolve conflicts, and keep their workflow smooth.
    </p>
    <h3 style="color: purple"> A Day in the Life of the Dev Team </h3>
     <b>Task 1:  Checking the Status</b>
    <P>Mary started her day by making some changes to the project‚Äôs HTML file to improve the header design. 
    She wanted to ensure her changes were properly tracked before committing them.
    She ran the following command: <br>
    <pre> git status</pre><br>
    "Hey team, I see the header file I edited is showing up as modified. Let me stage it!" said Mary.
    Mary staged her changes: <br>
    <pre>git add header.html</pre> <br>
    Then, she committed them:
     <pre>git commit -m "Updated header design" </pre> <br>
        Mary recalled in her mind that <code>git status</code>helps check which files are modified, staged, or untracked, making it easier to manage changes.
    </P>
    <b>Task 2: Checking the Project History</b>
    <p>
    Jane wanted to see all the commits made so far in the project. She used the following command: <br>
        <pre>git log --oneline</pre> <br>
    "Wow, this shows a clean summary of our commits!" Jane exclaimed.
    She noticed that Mary‚Äôs "Updated header design" commit was the latest.
    Jane then ran: <pre>git log</pre> to see the detailed commit history with author names and timestamps.
    She murmured that the <pre>git log</pre> command provides insights into the project's progress and who made changes.
        and to show changes between working directory and index or between commits, use this command:<br>
        <code>git diff</code> <br>
    </p>
    <b>Task 3: Trouble with Merging</b>
    <p>
    Raja was working on a new feature in a branch called <b>feature-footer </b>. 
    Meanwhile, Mary updated the same part of the HTML file in the <b>main</b> branch.
    When Raja tried to merge his branch into <b>main</b>, he ran into an issue: <br>
        <code>git checkout main</code>
        <code>git merge feature-footer</code> <br>
       <b style="color:tomato;"> Git threw a warning: </b> <br>
        <code>CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in footer.html</code> <br>
        "Uh-oh! A merge conflict," Raja said nervously. "But no worries, I can handle this."<br>
       <b style="color:green;"> What Raja Did: </b><br>
        <b>1. </b>Opened the footer.html file.<br>
        <b>2. </b>Found the conflict markers <br>
        <pre><<<<<<< HEAD
        <footer>Updated by Mary</footer>
         =======
         <footer>New feature by Raja</footer>
         >>>>>>> feature-footer</pre> <br>
        <b>3. </b>Edited the file to merge the changes:
        <code><footer>Updated by Mary and enhanced by Raja</footer></code><br>
        <b>4. </b> Staged the resolved file: <br>
        <code>git add footer.html</code> <br>
        <b>5. </b> Committed the changes:
        <code>git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict in footer.html"</code> <br>
        "Great work, üôå  Raja!" Mary and Jane cheered. 
        so, they understood that Merge conflicts occur when Git doesn‚Äôt know which change to keep. 
        Resolving them involves carefully reviewing and editing the conflicting files.
    </p>
        <b>Task :4  Pushing Changes to GitHub</b>
    <p>Once the conflict was resolved, Raja pushed the updated branch to GitHub by using the command: <br>
    <code>git push origin main</code><br>
    The team reviewed the changes on GitHub and confirmed everything was working fine. 
        So, üìù remember always push your changes after resolving conflicts to keep the remote repository up-to-date.
