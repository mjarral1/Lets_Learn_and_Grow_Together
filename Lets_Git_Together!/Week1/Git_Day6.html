        <h2 style="color: orange">Review of Lesson 1 to Lesson 5: </h2>
    <p>In previous lessons, we have covered how to set up Git and GitHub accounts, as well as how to initialize repositories.
        We also learned some basic Git commands like git add, git commit, git push, and more. Additionally, 
     we explored how to create, switch, merge, push, pull, and remove branches in a Git repository.
        We also have learned how to review and revert unwanted changes and how to collaborate with other teams with in a shared repository of a project.
        <br>
    </p>
  <h3 style="color: purple"> The Milestone Celebration </h3>
         <p>
After successfully mastering forks, pull requests, and upstream syncing in Lesson 5, the senior developer gathered Mary, Jane, and Raja for another critical learning session. 
<br> This time, the team would explore how to use tags and releases in Git to mark important milestones in their project.
<br>
The senior developer began explanation with a story:<br>
“Imagine you’re working on software, and after weeks of coding, you finally finish version 1.0. <br>
You want to freeze that exact state of the project for everyone to reference in the future. <br>
That’s where Git tags and releases come into play.”
             <br>
Mary, Jane, and Raja were eager to learn how they could use these tools to become even better at managing their projects.
             
         </p>
         <h3 style="color: green"> Freezing Time with Tags and Releases </h3> <br>
         <b style="color: orange">Task 1: Understanding Tags</b> <br>
         <p>
         The senior developer explained: <br>
“Tags are like labels you attach to specific commits in your project. <br>
They’re perfect for marking key milestones like software releases or significant updates.”<br>
“Cool!” said Jane. “So it’s like bookmarking an important page in a book?” <br>
“Exactly!” replied the mentor. “Let’s create one together.” <br>
         </p>
         <b style ="color: Blue">Task 2: Creating a Lightweight Tag</b> <br>
         <p>
         The team decided to mark the milestone for completing their first feature. <br>
Raja used the following command to create a lightweight tag:<br>
         <code>git tag v1.0</code> <br>
         “Done!” Raja exclaimed. <br>
         Mary asked, “How do we share this tag with others?” <br>
The developer replied, “Push the tag to the remote repository.” <br>
Raja pushed the tag: <br>
         <code>git push origin v1.0</code>
         </p>
         <b style="color:tomato"> Task 3: Annotated Tags for Detailed Milestones</b> <br>
         <p>
The senior developer then introduced annotated tags, which allow adding descriptions to the tag: <br>
“Let’s create a detailed tag for our release,” said the developer. <br>
Jane created an annotated tag: <br>
             <code>git tag -a v1.1 -m "Release version 1.1: Added user login feature"</code> <br>
             <code>git push origin v1.1</code> <br>
             “Now, anyone can see the details of this version by typing <code>git show v1.1 </code>,” said Jane proudly.
</p>
<b style="color:navy"> Task 4: Viewing and Deleting Tags </b><br>
 <p>
Mary was curious: “What if I accidentally create the wrong tag?” <br>
The mentor reassured her: <br>
“You can delete tags locally and remotely.”<br>
Mary tried: <br>
     <code>git tag -d v1.0 </code> <br>
<code>git push origin --delete v1.0</code> <br>
 </p>
     <b style="color: darkgray"> Task 5:Publishing Releases on GitHub</b> <br>
           <p>
               The team moved on to GitHub, where the senior developer explained how to create releases: <br>
               <b>1. </b>Navigate to the Releases tab in the repository. <br>
              <b>2. </b>Click Draft a new release. <br>
              <b>3. </b>Select the tag version (e.g., v1.1), add a title, and write release notes.<br>
              <b>4. </b>Click Publish Release. <br>
              Jane commented, “Releases make it easier to share updates with the world, including compiled binaries or release notes.”<br>
         </p>
         <b style="color:brown"> Task 6: Resolving Errors in Tagging</b>
         <p>
             As they practiced, Raja accidentally created a tag on the wrong commit. Jane helped him fix it:<br>
             <b>1.</b> Delete the incorrect tag:<br>
             <code>git tag -d v1.2</code> <br>
             <b>2.</b> Create a new tag on the correct commit: <br>
             <code>git tag v1.2 correct-commit-hash</code>
                <code>git push origin v1.2</code>
         </p>
         <b style="color:black">Key Takeaways:</b> <br>
         <p> Team gathered for a final review trainning session of the day.<br>
         <b>1. </b> Tags are labels that mark specific commits, perfect for milestones. <br>
<b>2. </b>Lightweight tags are simple labels, while annotated tags include details.<br>
<b>3. </b>Releases on GitHub allow you to share updates with users, including notes and compiled files. <br>
<b>4. </b>Managing tags effectively helps maintain a clear project history.<br>
