   <section>
        <h2 style="color: green">Week: 1 </h2> 
        <p>Understand basic Git operations: setting up, creating, and committing in repositories, with a focus on tracking changes and basic branching.</p>
       <h2 style="color: blue">Day: 7</h2> 
           For Lesson 7, we will review our learning of Week 1 and work on a mini project.
       We will build a data dictionary for Git and GitHub usage.<br>
   </section>
     <section>
        <h2 style="color: orange">Review of Lesson 1 to Lesson 6: </h2>
    <p>In previous lessons, we have covered how to set up Git and GitHub accounts, as well as how to initialize repositories.
        We also learned some basic Git commands like git add, git commit, git push, and more. Additionally, 
     we explored how to create, switch, merge, push, pull, and remove branches in a Git repository.
        We also have learned how to review and revert unwanted changes and how to collaborate with other teams with in a shared repository of a project.
        We also learned about tags and marking milestones of the project.
        <br>
    </p>
         <h3 style="color: purple"> The Power of Team Collaboration </h3>
         By Day 7 of their Git learning journey, Mary, Jane, and Raja were growing confident in their Git and GitHub skills.<br>
         However, the senior software developer challenged them to consolidate everything they had learned so far by working on a mini project together. <br>
         The goal: Create a collaborative Git Commands Data Dictionary repository.<br>
         <p>This exercise would simulate a real-world software development scenario, teaching them how to use commands from Day 1 to Day 7 cohesively, 
         resolve potential errors, and create a shared repository that others could benefit from. </p>     
        “Let’s see if you can combine your knowledge of Git commands and GitHub workflows to create something meaningful,” said the senior developer.<br>
         <h3 style="color: green"> Creating the Data Dictionary </h3> <br>
         <b style="color: orange">Task 1:  Setting Up the Repository</b> <br>
         <p>
             The team decided that Jane, being the most experienced, would create the repository and set up the initial structure. <br>
             Jane created a new repository on GitHub called <code>git-commands-dictionary</code>. <br>
             <code>git init git-commands-dictionary </code> <br>
              <code>cd git-commands-dictionary</code> <br>
             She added a <code>README.md </code> file with a project description: <br>
             <pre># Git Commands Data Dictionary </pre>  <br>
<pre>collaborative repository documenting Git commands and their uses.</pre> <br>
         Jane made the first commit and pushed it to the remote repository: <br>
        <code>git add README.md </code> <br>
<code>git commit -m "Initial commit: Added README with project description" </code><br>
<code>git branch -M main </code> <br>
<code>git remote add origin GitHub-repo-URL </code> <br>
<code>git push -u origin main </code> <br>
         <b style ="color: Blue">Task 2: Branching for Collaboration</b> <br>
         <p>
             The mentor explained: “Each of you will work on a different section of the data dictionary using separate branches. <br>
             This avoids conflicts and promotes clean collaboration.” <br>
             Mary created a branch for basic Git commands: <br>

             <code>git checkout -b basic-commands</code> <br>
             Raja created a branch for advanced Git commands: <br>
             <code>git checkout -b advanced-commands</code> <br>
             Jane created a branch for GitHub workflows: <br>
             <code>git checkout -b github-workflows</code> <br>
             Each member added a new Markdown file for their respective sections. <br>
         </p>
         <b style="color:tomato"> Task 3: Committing and Pushing Changes</b> <br>
         <p>
Each team member worked on their branches, adding commands to their respective files: <br>
           <b>Mary:</b> <br>
             - Edited <code>basic-commands.md</code> to document commands like <code>git init, git status, and git add. </code> <br>
             - Staged and committed her changes: <br>
             <code>git add basic-commands.md </code> <br>
<code>git commit -m "Added documentation for basic Git commands"</code> <br>
                - Pushed her branch to GitHub: <br>
        <code>git push origin basic-commands</code> <br>
           <b>Raja:</b> <br>
            - Edited <code>advanced-commands.md </code> to cover commands like <code>git rebase and git cherry-pick</code>. <br>
            -Staged, committed, and pushed his branch. <br>
<b>Jane:</b> <br>
             -Edited <code> github-workflows.md </code>to explain GitHub actions like pull requests and releases.<br>
             -Staged, committed, and pushed her branch.            
         </p>
    
<b style="color:navy"> Task 4: Pull Requests and Reviews</b><br>
<p>
    The senior softwared developer guided the team to create pull requests and review each other’s work. <br>
Mary created a pull request for her <code>basic-commands </code> branch on GitHub.<br>
Jane reviewed the changes, suggesting an edit to improve the explanation of <code>git status </code>. <br>
Mary implemented the suggestions, committed the changes, and updated the pull request: <br>
    <code>git add basic-commands.md</code> <br>
    <code> git commit -m "Updated git status explanation"</code><br>
    <code> git push origin basic-commands</code> <br>
     Raja and Jane also followed the same process for their branches.<br>
    </p>
     <b style="color: green"> Task 5: Merging to Main</b> <br>
         <p>
             After resolving all feedback, the mentor instructed the team to merge the branches into the <code>main</code> branch. <br>
             Jane merged the pull requests for all branches: <br>
             <code> git checkout main</code> <br>
             <code>git merge basic-commands</code> <br>
             <code> git merge advanced-commands</code> <br>
             <code> git merge github-workflows</code> <br>
             <code> git push origin main</code> <br>
              </p>
         <b style="color:brown"> Task 6: Resolving Merge Conflicts </b> <br>
    <p>
         During the merge, Raja encountered a conflict in <code>README.md </code> With guidance from the senior developer, he resolved it:
    <br>
        <b>1. </b> Opened the conflicting file.<br>
        <b>2. </b>Fixed the conflict by keeping the correct lines. <br>
        <b>3. </b> Added the resolved file:<br>
        <code>git add README.md</code> <br>
        <b>4. </b> Committed the fix: <br>
        <code>git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict in README.md" </code>
    </p>

         <b style="color:red">Task 7: Creating a Release</b> <br>
         <p>
             Once all changes were merged, the mentor asked the team to create a GitHub release for version <code> v1.0:</code> <br>
             <b>1. </b>Navigate to the Releases tab on GitHub. <br>
             <b>2. </b> Click Draft a new release.<br>
             <b>3. </b>Select the main branch and tag version <code>v1.0.</code> <br>
             <b>4. </b> Add release notes summarizing the commands included in the data dictionary.<br>
             <b>5. </b> Publish the release.<br>

             
         </p>
         
         <b style="color:black">Key Takeaways:</b> <br>
         <b>1. </b>Git commands can be combined to manage collaborative workflows effectively.<br>
         <b> 2. </b>Branching allows parallel development, while pull requests enable code reviews. <br>
         <b>3. </b>Resolving conflicts is a crucial skill for teamwork.<br>
         <b>4. </b>Creating releases on GitHub is a great way to mark project milestones. <br>
