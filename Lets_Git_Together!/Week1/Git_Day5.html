    <p>In previous lessons, we have covered how to set up Git and GitHub accounts, as well as how to initialize repositories.
        We also learned some basic Git commands like git add, git commit, git push, and more. Additionally, 
     we explored how to create, switch, merge, push, pull, and remove branches in a Git repository.
        We also have learned how to review and revert unwanted changes.<br>

         <h3 style="color: purple"> Working Across Teams </h3>
         <p>
             On Day 5, Mary, Jane, and Raja were tasked with collaborating with another team on a shared GitHub repository. 
             To their surprise, the repository didn’t allow them to push changes directly.
             Instead, they had to use forks, clones, and pull requests to contribute. <br>
             Join the trio as they navigate this new collaboration model and master advanced GitHub workflows.</p> <br>
         <p>
          <b>Task 1:  Forking the Repository </b> <br>
             One of the senior software developers explained the tasks to the team: <br>
             "The repository you’ll be working on belongs to another team, so you won’t have direct push access.<br>
             You’ll need to fork it to your own GitHub accounts to start contributing." <br>
             "Fork? What’s that?" asked Raja. <br>
             Mary answered, "A fork is like creating your personal copy of the repository on GitHub. <br>
             You can make changes there without affecting the original project."<br>
             Following their senior’s instructions, each team member forked the repository by clicking the Fork button on the project’s GitHub page.
             <br> 
         </p>
         <p>
             <b>Task 2:  Cloning the Fork </b> <br>
         Next, they cloned their forks to their local machines: <br>
             <pre>git clone <fork-URL></pre> <br>
         Raja typed: <br>
         <pre>git clone https://github.com/raja123/forked-repo.git</pre> <br>
         Jane added, "Now we can work on this project locally, just like we did with our own repositories."<br>
