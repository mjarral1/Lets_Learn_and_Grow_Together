    <p>In previous lessons, we have covered how to set up Git and GitHub accounts, as well as how to initialize repositories.
        We also learned some basic Git commands like git add, git commit, git push, and more. Additionally, 
     we explored how to create, switch, merge, push, pull, and remove branches in a Git repository.
        We also have learned how to review and revert unwanted changes.<br>

         <h3 style="color: purple"> Working Across Teams </h3>
         <p>
             On Day 5, Mary, Jane, and Raja were tasked with collaborating with another team on a shared GitHub repository. 
             To their surprise, the repository didn’t allow them to push changes directly.
             Instead, they had to use forks, clones, and pull requests to contribute. <br>
             Join the trio as they navigate this new collaboration model and master advanced GitHub workflows.</p> <br>
         <p>
          <b>Task 1:  Forking the Repository </b> <br>
             One of the senior software developers explained the tasks to the team: <br>
             "The repository you’ll be working on belongs to another team, so you won’t have direct push access.<br>
             You’ll need to fork it to your own GitHub accounts to start contributing." <br>
             "Fork? What’s that?" asked Raja. <br>
             Mary answered, "A fork is like creating your personal copy of the repository on GitHub. <br>
             You can make changes there without affecting the original project."<br>
             Following their senior’s instructions, each team member forked the repository by clicking the Fork button on the project’s GitHub page.
             <br> 
         </p>
         <p>
             <b>Task 2:  Cloning the Fork </b> <br>
         Next, they cloned their forks to their local machines: <br>
             <code>git clone <fork-URL></code> <br>
         Raja typed: <br>
         <pre>git clone https://github.com/raja123/forked-repo.git</pre> <br>
         Jane added, "Now we can work on this project locally, just like we did with our own repositories."<br>
         </p>
         <p>
             <b>Task 3: Making Changes </b> <br>
             Each team member switched to a new branch to work on their tasks: <br>
             <code>git checkout -b feature-update</code> <br>
             Mary fixed a typo in the project documentation. <br>
            Raja improved a function in the code.<br>
            Jane added unit tests for the new function. <br>
 They all staged and committed their changes: <br>
             <code>git add . </code> <br>
<code>git commit -m "Fix typo in documentation"</code> <br>
             
         </p>
         <p>
             <b>Task 4: Pushing Changes to the Fork </b> <br>
             "Since we’re working on forks, we’ll push our changes to our own repositories," said Mary. <br>
        Each team member pushed their changes: <br>
             <code>git push origin feature-update</code> <br>
         </p>
         <p>
             <b>Task 5: Creating a Pull Request  </b> <br>
             "Now comes the exciting part: contributing to the original repository using a pull request!" exclaimed Jane. <br>
             They went to their GitHub forks, clicked on the Pull Requests tab, and selected New Pull Request. <br>
             They compared their branches to the original repository’s <code>main</code> branch and submitted pull requests with clear descriptions of their changes.<br>     
         </p>
         <p>
             <b>Task 6: Reviewing and Merging Pull Requests </b> <br>
             Mary asked, "What if the original repository gets updated after we fork it? How do we stay up to date?" <br>
             Excellent question! Then senior developers introduced them to the concept of the upstream repository: <br>
             <code>git remote add upstream <original-repo-URL></code> <br>
             <code>git fetch upstream</code> <br>
             <code>git merge upstream/main</code> <br>
             Mary practiced syncing her fork and shared her updates with the team. <br>
         </p>
         <p>
             Senior developer then concluded today's lesson for the team: <br>
             <b>1.</b> Forks let you work on repositories you don’t own.<br>
             <b>2.</b>Clones bring remote repositories to your local machine.<br>
             <b>3.</b>Pull requests enable you to contribute changes back to the original repository. <br> 
             <b>4.</b>Upstream syncing ensures your fork stays up to date with the original repository. <br>
             <br> Would you like additional examples or clarification on any part? Senior Developer asked to the team.
             <br>
             Mary, Jane, and Raja thumbs up and started to review the tasks of the day!
