        <h2 style="color: orange">Review of Lesson 1, 2, and 3: </h2>
    <p>In previous lessons, we covered how to set up Git and GitHub accounts, as well as how to initialize repositories. We also learned some basic Git commands like git add, git commit, git push, and more. Additionally, 
     we explored how to create, switch, merge, push, pull, and remove branches in a Git repository. We also learned how to track Changes made to files and how to resolve merge conflict in Git.

         <h3 style="color: purple"> Another Day in the Life of the Dev Team! </h3>
        <p>Mary, Jane, and Raja have made significant progress in their project by mastering Git basics, branching, merging, and resolving conflicts. But today, something unexpected happenedâ€”Raja accidentally committed incorrect code that broke the build!
      The team must now use their Git skills to review and revert changes, ensuring the project gets back on track.
     <br>Letâ€™s join them on Day 4 of their Git learning journey.</p>
        <br>
        <h3 style="color: blue"> Troubleshooting and Reverting Mistakes! </h3><br>
        <b style="color:red"> Identifying the Problem </b>
        <p>
            It was a regular morning stand-up when Jane noticed that the latest build of their web application wasnâ€™t working.<br>
            "Uh-oh, the website is showing an error page. Did anyone make changes to the main branch recently?" she asked.<br>
            Raja sheepishly replied, "I did... but I didnâ€™t realize it would cause an issue. Let me check."
            <br> 
            Raja used the following command to check the latest commits:
            <code>git log --oneline</code> <br>
            He spotted his commit with the message "Updated JavaScript logic." 
            "Looks like ðŸ¤” I made the last change," Raja admitted.
        </p>
         <b style="color:purple"> Reviewing the Changes: </b>
        <p>
            To understand what went wrong, Mary suggested reviewing the commit differences: <br>
           <b><code>git show <commit-hash></code>  </b> <br>
            <br> They examined the output:
            - // Old logic <br>
            + // Incorrect updated logic <br>
            <br>
           <ul> "Ah, thereâ€™s the mistake! Raja, you added an incorrect calculation here," Mary pointed out. </ul>
        </p>
        <b style="color:purple"> Reverting the Changes: </b>
    <p>The team decided to revert the problematic commit.<br>
    "Donâ€™t worry, Raja. Letâ€™s use <b><code>git revert </code> </b> to undo the changes from your commit without rewriting history," said Jane. <br>
    Raja followed Janeâ€™s instructions: <br>
    <b><code>git revert <commit-hash></code> <br> </b>
    A text editor opened for Raja to add a commit message. He entered: <br>
    <b><code> Reverted incorrect JavaScript logic update </code> </b>
        <br>
    Raja saved and closed the editor, and the revert was committed. 
    </p>
        <b style="color:purple"> Pushing the Fix to GitHub: </b>
        <p>
            To make the fix available to everyone, Raja pushed the reverted commit to the remote repository: 
            <br>
           <b><code>git push origin main</code> </b> <br>
            "Great job, Raja! The website is back to normal now," said Mary with relief.
        </p>
        <b style="color:purple"> Reflecting on Lessons Learned: </b>
        <p>
            Jane shared some insights: <br>
            <ul>
                  <b>1.</b>Reviewing commits with <b><code> git show </code> </b> helps pinpoint errors. 
                <br>
                  <b>2.</b> <b><code> git revert </code> </b> is the safest way to undo changes without altering history.
                <br>
                  <b>3.</b>Always test changes locally before committing to the main branch!
                <br>
            </ul> 
        Mary added, "Letâ€™s also use <code><b>git diff</b> </code> </b> more often to review changes before committing."
